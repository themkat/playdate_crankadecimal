* Crank a Decimal
Simple Playdate application to get familiar with the Lua SDK.

** Goals
The main goal here is to get some practice with the SDK before more advanced projects and games. Most importantly:

- Have a simple toy project to get familiar with the Lua SDK
- Learn how to handle the values from the crank.
- Experiment with simple settings and save them for later application invocations.
- Experiment with custom data, like fonts and the cover image.
- Make a small desktop utility that might prove useful as a calculator for at least hexadecimal, binary, and decimal. Maybe also octal. Might be super useful for my embedded and retro programming projects. Built to my preferences.
